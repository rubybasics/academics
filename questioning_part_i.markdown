# Teaching Strategies: Questioning in the Classroom, Part I

## Goals

* explain importance of questioning during instruction
* differentiate between open and closed questions
* determine where questions fall on Bloom's Taxonomy
* brainstorm open and closed questions to ask in example lesson 

## Intro

* What is an instructor's job? 
* What is questioning?
* How does questioning enhance student participation, engagement, and ultimately achievement? 

## Background & Reflection

Read [this article](http://oer.educ.cam.ac.uk/wiki/Teaching_Approaches/Questioning) from The University of Cambridge. As you read, think about and answer the following questions:

1) Look at the bullet point list under “Why Question?” Which point(s) would you like to improve in your own teaching?

2) Do you do more open or closed questioning in your classes right now?

3) Think back to a lesson you taught this week. If you were to re-teach that lesson, what is an example of an effective question you would ask? 

4) Given the ideas suggested in the article, what is one thing you will try in order to enhance engagement and participation in questioning? 

5) What are some of the challenges of questioning students while teaching? 

## Example Walk Through

Let's walk through a 10-minute example from a debugging code-along. As we do this, we'll brainstorm questions that could be asked in addition to classifying the question type (open vs. closed, where the question falls in Bloom's Taxonomy).

## Work Time

Choose a lesson you'll teach in the next week or two. Brainstorm and add at least three effective questions that could be asked during that class, and add them to the lesson plan.
