# Teaching Strategies: Questioning in the Classroom, Part II

## Goals

* define cold call, wait time, everybody writes, and no opt-out
* demonstrate effective questioning strategies to use during instruction

## Intro

Last week, we talked about types of questions: open, closed, levels on Bloom's Taxonomy. This week, we'll discuss effecive ways to use these questions during instruction. 

## Background

  * Planned and effective questioning increases engagement
  * Good questions become ineffective unless the delivery is executed well
  * Reject self-report: "Is everyone clear about...", "Do you all understand?"

## Techniques

The following strategies are from Doug Lemov's book _Teach Like a Champion_. In groups, figure out what the strategy means in practice and be ready to demo what the strategy looks like. Most of these descriptions are written with middle to high school students in mind, so another challenge will be to figure out what the implementation looks like at Turing.
