# Academic Workshop -- Wednesday, 7/15

### Instructional Strategy: Flipped Classroom

In a true "flipped classroom" lesson, videos are assigned for students to watch as pre-work, then in-class time is used for Q&A, discussions, projects, and practice. 

* Choose one lesson from 7/20 - 7/31 to implement using the "flipped classroom" lesson model
* Try either: 
  - True flipped lesson: record a session beforehand as homework or assign material to read, and use class time as a workshop where instructor is available to answer questions
  - Preview flipped lesson: record a <10 minute video beforehand and explain key concepts or prepare a written explanation, then use class time to dive deep into those concepts
* Discuss results at workshop on Wednesday, 8/5

### Cross-Instructor Observations

* Two-week period: 7/20 - 7/31
* Set up time to go watch >= 1 lesson
* Set up a time to meet afterward to review notes

##### Things to look for

* What strategies is the instructor using that are particularly effective? Could you incorporate these strategies into your own lessons?
* Lesson type: Was it a lecture? Code-along? Was this the most effective method of delivery for this topic? 
* What could be changed about this lesson in order to differentiate for advanced and struggling students? 
* Are students getting an opportunity to practice the concept/skill in class? How? If not, what could be added? 
* Are the goals of the lesson clear? Are students aware of what they should get out of the class? 
* Is the class relevant to the current project? If not, is there a better place in the module for this class?
